# Lab Aurelia 4 Exercises 


## Exercise 1: Retrieve prior donations

When you first log in, modify app such that existing donations are retrieved from donation-web. Currently we only show donations made my the current user.

## src/services/donation-service.js

~~~
  ...
  constructor(data, ea, ac) {
    ...
    this.getDonations();
  }

  getDonations() {
    this.ac.get('/api/donations').then(res => {
      this.donations = res.content;
    });
  }
...

Note: this solution will be invalidated by our forthcoming approach to authenticated routes, and will need to be changed later.

~~~
# Exercise 2: Show Candidate names in report 

Notice that, when you make a donation - the actual candidate's name does not appear. Why is this? In chrome, debug into the app to explore why. See if you can fix this. 

There are two approaches:

- You already know the candidate name in the donation-client, so just insert it into the donation.
- Change donation-web to populate the donation's candidate field when you create a donation.


## Solution

This is a modification of the donation-web api for creating donations:

~~~
exports.makeDonation = {

  auth: false,

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    const donation = new Donation(request.payload);
    donation.candidate = request.params.id;
    donation.save().then(newDonation => {
      Donation.findOne(newDonation).populate('candidate').then(donation => {
        reply(donation).code(201);
      });
    }).catch(err => {
      reply(Boom.badImplementation('error making donation'));
    });
  },

};
~~~

When a donation is created, it populates the candidate field. No further modification should be neccessary.
