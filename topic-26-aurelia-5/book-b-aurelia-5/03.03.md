# donation-service login/logout

DonationService can now have its login/logout methods use the new methods.

First, remove retrieval of users and donations in the constructor:

## src/services/donation-service.js

~~~
  constructor(data, ea, ac) {
    this.methods = data.methods;
    this.ea = ea;
    this.ac = ac;
    this.getCandidates();
  }
~~~

the users and candidates are protected routes, and will fail if we attempt to read them if we are not authenticated.

Now we can implement login/logout - which are considerably simplified:

## src/services/donation-service.js

~~~
  login(email, password) {
    const user = {
      email: email,
      password: password
    };
    this.ac.authenticate('/api/users/authenticate', user);
  }
~~~

~~~
  logout() {
    const status = {
      success: false,
      message: ''
    };
    this.ac.clearAuthentication();
   this.ea.publish(new LoginStatus(status));
  }
}
~~~

Try this now and see if it works as expected. In particular make sure you can successfully access protected routes.
