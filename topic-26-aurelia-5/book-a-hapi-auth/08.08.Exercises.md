## Exercise 1: Record the donor when a donation is created.

Currently, we the api is still not recording the `donor` for a given donation. We can verify this on our unit tests:

~~~
  test('create a donation', function () {
    const returnedCandidate = donationService.createCandidate(newCandidate);
    donationService.makeDonation(returnedCandidate._id, donations[0]);
    const returnedDonations = donationService.getDonations(returnedCandidate._id);
    assert.equal(returnedDonations.length, 1);
    assert.isUndefined(returnedDonations[0].donor);
    assert(_.some([returnedDonations[0]], donations[0]), 'returned donation must be a superset of donation');
  }
~~~

The second last line above:

~~~
    assert.isUndefined(returnedDonations[0].donor);
~~~

Verifies that the donor is not recorded. Try to make sure the donor is recorded in a field when the a donation is created

## HINT:

This is an extract for the web controller fulfilling the same function:

## app/controllers/donations.js

~~~
exports.donate = {
  ...
  handler: function (request, reply) {
    var userEmail = request.auth.credentials.loggedInUser;
    let userId = null;
    let donation = null;
    User.findOne({ email: userEmail }).then(user => {
      ...
  },
  ...
~~~

In the above, identifying the donor is via the logged in user:

~~~
    var userEmail = request.auth.credentials.loggedInUser;
~~~

For our api `makeDonation` function, the equivalent will be the token available via the request:

~~~
exports.makeDonation = {
  ...

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    const donation = new Donation(request.payload);
    donation.candidate = request.params.id;

    const authorization = request.headers.authorization;
    // extract token, decode id and recover user id for donor.
    donation.donor = ????

    donation.donor = utils.getUserIdFromRequest(request);
    donation.save().then(newDonation => {
      reply(newDonation).code(201);
    }).catch(err => {
      reply(Boom.badImplementation('error making donation'));
    });
  },

};
~~~

Make sure to write a test to verify that donor is part of the donation.
