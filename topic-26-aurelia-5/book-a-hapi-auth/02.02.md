# JWT Libraries

Currently our API is completely open - as we have disabled any authentication strategy on each of these routes:

~~~
...
  auth: false,
...
~~~

This is deliberate, as the authentication strategy we have install in the app is unsuitable:

~~~
  server.auth.strategy('session', 'cookie', true, {
    password: 'password-should-be-32-characters',
    cookie: 'donation',
    redirectTo: '/login',
    isSecure: false,
  });
~~~

This strategy utilities the browser cookie facility - is not appropriate for an API (where there may be no browser). We need an alternative strategy to secure the API.

One of the most common approaches is called `JSON Web Tokens`:

- <https://jwt.io/>

and we will employ a simple version of it now. These are two libraries we will use:

- <https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2>
- <https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken>

Install both a part of our application:

~~~
npm install hapi-auth-jwt2 -save
npm install jsonwebtoken -save
~~~
