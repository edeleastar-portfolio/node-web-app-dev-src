Archive of the lab so far:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/donation-client-ts/releases/tag/aurelia.lab.5.end>

## Exercise 1:

Deploy the donation-web & donation-client apps. There are two potential scenarios:

- Deploy donation-web to heroku, and donation-client to github - gh-pages - as outlined in an earlier lab
- Deploy both apps to heroku, coping `index.html` + `scripts` to the public folder of the donation-web app

Make sure that `src/sercices/fixtures.js` contains the correct url in each instance.
