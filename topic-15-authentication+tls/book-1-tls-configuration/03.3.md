# Hapi/Node TLS Configuration

You can configure a Hapi.js server to listen for HTTPS connections.

* Make a directory (called *private*, for example) in a Hapi application and copy your *webserver.key* and *webserver.crt* files there. You may use an application you are working on, or download the very basic application provided [here](archive/hapi_example.js).<br><br>

* Add the following lines before adding a server connection:
<pre>
const fs = require('fs');
var options = {
    port: 4443,     //  or any port you wish
    tls: {
        key: fs.readFileSync('private/webserver.key'),
        cert: fs.readFileSync('private/webserver.crt')
    }
};
</pre>

* Then pass options as a parameter to *server.connection()*:
<pre>
server.connection(options);
</pre>

* Next start the server 
~~~
node hapi_tls_example.js
~~~

* Test that itâ€™s working by pointing a web browser to [https://localhost:4443](https://localhost:4443) (replace *localhost* if published elsewhere).<br><br>

* Replace the reference to webserver.crt with *webserver_self.crt* as created in step 2, restart node and browse again to [https://localhost:4443](https://localhost:4443). Have a look at the certificate trust chain and see the difference.
