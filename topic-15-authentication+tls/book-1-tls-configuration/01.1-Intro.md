## Certificate Authorities

The term *Certificate Authority (CA)* refers to anyone who issues (i.e. signs) digital certificates. 
As we'll see below, anyone (even you!) can be a CA, though certain CAs are widely trusted on the Internet and their certificates are accepted by browsers that support them.

Most widely-recognised certificate authorities charge a fee for issuing certificates. Examples are Comodo GoDaddy, DigiCert and GlobalSign. Some have free trial certificates with short validity period (e.g. 30 days).  There are also some free services, including [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
In practice, this is where you would get a certificate for a production server.  For the purposes of this lab, however, we will generate our own.
