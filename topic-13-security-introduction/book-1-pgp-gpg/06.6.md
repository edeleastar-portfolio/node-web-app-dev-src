## 5. Command-line GPG – *optional*
*You may optionally skip this step if you have used a GPG or PGP GUI application and proceed to step 7.*

Command-line GPG is included in many Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) and versions for other operating systems can be downloaded from http://www.gnupg.org/download/. The instructions below are based on command-line usage on Linux. 

As with most Linux commands, you can get a full list of usage options by entering:
~~~
man gpg
~~~
or for more concise information, you can enter:
~~~
gpg --help
~~~
Verify which version of GPG you have with the command:
~~~
gpg --version
~~~

Use GPG to generate a key pair, import/export keys and carry out encryption and authentication – i.e. to do the same things as we did with PGP. There are numerous online tutorials with the steps required – [this one is clear and concise](http://bitflop.com/tutorials/gnupg-tutorial.html)

If you are using a virtual machine, it may be difficult for GPG to find sufficient random data to generate keys.  If gpg –-gen-key stalls due to a lack of random data, enter the following commands which get it to use the Linux built-in pseudorandom generator:
~~~
   sudo apt-get install rng-tools
   sudo sh -c 'echo "HRNGDEVICE=/dev/urandom" >> /etc/default/rng-tools'
   sudo /etc/init.d/rng-tools start
~~~

Summary of main usage options:
~~~
gpg --gen-key                           #create a key pair
gpg --import [File]                     #import someone’s public key from file
gpg --list-keys                         #show list of keys
gpg -e -r Recipient [File]              #encrypt file (giving it .gpg extension)
gpg -e --default-recipient-self [File]  #encrypt file to self
gpg -d [File]                           #decrypt
gpg -s [File]                           #sign
gpg --verify [File]                     #verify
