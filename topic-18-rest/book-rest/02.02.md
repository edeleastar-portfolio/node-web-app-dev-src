# Retrieve All Donations API

Currently our api only supports candidate and user model access/update. What about donations?

We start with just retrieving donations:

## routesapi.js

~~~
...
const DonationsApi = require('./app/api/donationsapi');
...

  { method: 'GET', path: '/api/donations', config: DonationsApi.findAllDonations },
...
~~~

## api/donationsapi.js

~~~
'use strict';

const Donation = require('../models/donation');
const Boom = require('boom');

exports.findAllDonations = {

  auth: false,

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    Donation.find({}).populate('donor').populate('candidate').then(donations => {
      reply(donations);
    }).catch(err => {
      reply(Boom.badImplementation('error accessing db'));
    });
  },
};

~~~

We can use either a browser or postman to test this route:

- <http://localhost:4000/api/donations>

We are retrieving the seeded donations in the above.

It would be useful to write a test for this route also, but as we cannot yet make a donation the test will be of limited value. We will come back to this as soon as we figure out how making donations can be supported.
