# Very Simple Donation Persistence 

We can try to store some of the donations the user makes in an simple array. In `index.js`, include the following just before the plugins are registered:

## index.js

~~~
server.bind({
  donations: [],
});
~~~

Introduce this additional route, which is a `POST` route to accept donations:

##routes.js

~~~
  { method: 'POST', path: '/donate', config: Donations.donate },
~~~

We can now refactor the donations controller to store and retrieve these donations:

##app/controllers/donations.js

~~~
exports.report = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    reply.view('report', {
      title: 'Donations to Date',
      donations: this.donations,
    });
  },

};

exports.donate = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    const data = request.payload;
    this.donations.push(data);
    reply.redirect('/report');
  },

};

~~~

Rerun the app again - this time, if you proceed through login, you should be able to make donations, and see them on the report view.
