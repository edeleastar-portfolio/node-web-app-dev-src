#Exercise 1: Register Users

As well as storing the donations in the server bound objects:

~~~
server.bind({
  donations: [],
});
~~~

Try also storing a list of users - in a similar manner to to the donations:

~~~
server.bind({
  users: [],
  donations: [],
});
~~~

Using the donations controller as a guide, see if you can populate this array with new users as they are registered. You will need to write a new route for the signup form:

~~~
  { method: 'POST', path: '/register', config: Accounts.register },
~~~

and a matching handler:

~~~
exports.register = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    reply.redirect('/home');
  },

};
~~~


##Exercise 2: Current User

Try also to keep track of the current user:

~~~
server.bind({
  currentUser : {},
  users: [],
  donations: [],
});
~~~

Adjust your login controller to update this field.

On the report - include an extra column - `donor` - which should list the name of the donor (the user who is currently logged in),
