#Operators

Basic operators allow you to manipulate values.

```javascript
// Concatenation
const foo = 'hello';
const bar = 'world';

console.log(foo + ' ' + bar); // => hello world
```

```javascript
// Multiplication and division
2 * 3;
2 / 3;
```

```javascript
/**
 * Incrementing and decrementing
 * The pre-increment operator increments the operand before any further processing.
 * pre-increment:
 */

let i = 1;

console.log(++i); // 2
console.log(i);   // 2

/**
 * The post-increment operator increments the operand after processing it.
 * post-increment:
 */

let i = 1;

console.log(i++); // 1 - because i was 1
console.log(i);   // 2 - incremented after using it
```

## Operations on Numbers & Strings

In JavaScript, numbers and strings will occasionally behave in unexpected ways.

```javascript
// Addition vs. Concatenation
const foo = 1;
const bar = '2';

console.log(foo + bar); // 12
```

```javascript
// Coercing a string to act as a number:
const foo = 1;
const bar = '2';

console.log(foo + Number(bar)); // 3
console.log(foo + (+bar)); // also 3. +bar => numeric representation of object bar
```

The Number constructor, when called as a function (as in the above example), will have the effect of casting its argument into a number. The unary plus operator also does the same thing:

```javascript
// Forcing a string to act as a number (using the unary plus operator):
console.log(foo + +bar); // 3
```

##Exercise 6.1: Operators

Duplicate step5.html to a new file step6.html - and also create a new js file 'operators.js'. Link the script to the html file in the usual way. Incorporate the following code into the js file:

```
const foo = 1;
const bar = '2';
console.log(foo + bar);
```

```
const foo = 1;
const bar = '2';
console.log(foo + Number(bar));

console.log(foo + +bar); 
```

Run these programs and observe the results.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators allow evaluation of a series of operands using AND ( `&&` ) and OR ( `||` ) operations.

```javascript
// Logical AND and OR operators
const foo = 1;
const bar = 0;
const baz = 2;

// returns 1, which is true
console.log(foo || bar);

// returns 1, which is true
console.log(bar || foo);

// returns 0, which is false
console.log(foo && bar);

// returns 2, which is true
console.log(foo && baz);

// returns 1, which is true
console.log(baz && foo);
```

In the above example, the `||` operator returns the value of the first truthy operand, or in cases where neither operand is truthy, it returns the last operand. The `&&` operator returns the value of the first false operand, or the value of the last operand if both operands are truthy.

You'll sometimes see developers use these logical operators for flow control instead of using `if` statements. For example:

```javascript
// do something with foo if foo is truthy
foo && doSomething(foo);

/**
 * set bar to baz if baz is truthy;
 * otherwise, set it to the return
 * value of createBar()
 */
const bar = baz || createBar();

```

This style is quite elegant and pleasantly terse; that said, it can be really hard to read or use, especially for beginners. 

- See the section on truthy and falsy things in the [Conditional Code](http://learn.jquery.com/javascript-101/conditional-code/) article for more about evaluating truthiness.
- Further information is available on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) site at [Truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) and [Control Structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators allow you to test whether values are equivalent or whether values are identical.
```
// Comparison operators
const foo = 1;
const bar = 0;
const baz = '1';
const bim = 2;

foo == bar;   // false
foo != bar;   // true
foo == baz;   // true; Because == operator performs type coercion on different types

foo === baz;  // false
foo !== baz;  // true
foo === parseInt(baz); // true

foo > bim;  // false
bim > baz;  // true
foo <= baz;  // true

```

##Exercise: Operators

Create a step7.html + operators.js file in the usual manner.

Incorporate the 'logical operators' code fragment from above - and debug through them to verify the true/false values are as indicated.
