#Scope

"Scope" refers to the variables that are available to a piece of code at a given time. A lack of understanding of scope can lead to frustrating debugging experiences.

When a variable is declared inside of a function using the `var` keyword, it is only available to code inside of that function &#8212; code outside of that function cannot access the variable. On the other hand, functions defined inside that function will have access to to the declared variable.

When a `var` is declared and initialized within a function, the declaration is silently *hoisted* to the top of the function but not the assignment. The variable has what is termed *function scope*. This contrasts to *block scope* with which we are familiar from Java.

Study the section on [Hoisting](http://airbnb.io/javascript/#hoisting) in the Airbnb style guide.

Prior to ES6 JavaScript possessed *function scope* (and global scope). This still applies to `var` type for the purpose of backward compatibility. But two new variable types have been introduced in ES6, `const` and `let`, and these have block scope.

Furthermore, variables that are declared inside a function without the `var`, `const` or `let`keyword are not local to the function &#8212; JavaScript will traverse the scope chain all the way up to the window scope to find where the variable was previously defined. If the variable wasn't previously defined, it will be defined in the global scope which can have unexpected adverse consequences.

Whereas it is important for the purpose of code maintenance to recognize and understand the behaviour of the `var` type, its future use is discouraged. Instead, one should use `const` and `let`. Use `const` where reassignment is not envisaged, otherwise use `let`.

The first block of code below demonstrates the difference between function scope and block scope:

```javascript
/**
 * The variables a and b have block scope and are 'visible'
 * only within the if (flag) {...} block.
 * The variable c has function scope and is 'visible' within the entire
 * function myFunction block, including within the nested if block.
 */
function myFunction(flag) {
  if (flag) {
    const a = 1;  // The scope is inside the if-block
    let b = 2;  // The scope is inside the if-block
    var c = 3;  // The scope is inside the function

    // Both a and b in scope
    console.log(a);  // 1
    console.log(b);  // 2
    console.log(c);  // 3

  }

  // Only b is in scope here.
  console.log(a); // Uncaught ReferenceError because a has block scope
  console.log(b); // Uncaught ReferenceError because b has block scope
  console.log(c);  // 3 Because b has function scope
}

myFunction(true);
```

```javascript
// Functions have access to variables defined in the same scope
const foo = 'hello';
function sayHello() {
  console.log(foo);
};

sayHello(); // 'hello'
console.log(foo); // 'hello'
```

```javascript
/**
 * Code outside the scope in which a variable was defined does not have access
 * to the variable
 */

function sayHello() {
  const foo = 'hello';
  console.log(foo);
};

sayHello(); // hello
```

```javascript
/**
 * Variables with the same name can exist in different scopes
 * with different values
 */
const foo2 = 'world';

function sayHello() {
  const foo2 = 'hello';
  console.log(foo2);
};

sayHello(); // logs 'hello'
console.log(foo2); // logs 'world'
// Functions can see changes in variable values after the function is defined
function myFunction() {
  let foo2 = 'hello';

  function myFn() {
    console.log(foo2);
  };

  foo2 = 'world';
  return myFn;
};

const f = myFunction();

f(); // 'world'

```
#

```javascript
/**
 * Scope insanity
 * Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)
 * a self-executing anonymous function
 */

(function () {

  var baz = 100;

  var bim = function () {
    console.log(baz);
  };

  bar = function () {
    console.log(baz);
  };

}());

/**
 * The function bar() is defined outside of the anonymous function
 * because it wasn't declared with var and is therefore an implied global.
 * This is not recommended practice: adding to the global namespace.
 * And bar() has access to baz because outer function variables (and parameters) are available 
 * to inner functions: this is referred to as closure.
 */
bar(); // => 100
```
Attempting to access baz outside the IIFE above will fail:
```
(function () {
...
...
}());

/**
 * var baz has function scope and is not visible outside the IIFE.
 * Therefore attemting to access it here will generate an error:
 * Uncaught ReferenceError: baz is not defined
 */
console.log(baz);
```

The function bim() is also undefined outside the IIFE and so attempted invocation will fail.
```
(function () {
...
...
}());

/**
 * bim() is not defined outside of the anonymous function,
 * An attempt to invoke it will fail with this error:
 * Uncaught ReferenceError: baz is not defined
 */
bim();
```

All of the above behaviour applies in non-strict mode. Where ES6 strict mode is applied, the IIFE above will fail, generating an error warning that bar is not defined. That is, bar may no longer be defined as an implied global variable - which can only be good.

##Exercise: Scopes

Take the each of the above code fragements separately, 

- incorporate into a javascript file called 'scope.js' 
- debug though each in webstorm. Keep a close eye on the scope variable pane, and confirm that the behaviour is as expected.
