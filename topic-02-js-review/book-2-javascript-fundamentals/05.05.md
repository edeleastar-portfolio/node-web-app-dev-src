#Objects

Objects contain one or more key-value pairs. The key portion can be any string. The value portion can be any type of value: a number, a string, an array, a function, or even another object.  When one of these values is a function, itâ€™s called a method of the object. Otherwise, they are called properties.

As it turns out, nearly everything in JavaScript is an object &#8212; arrays, functions, numbers, even strings &#8212; and they all have properties and methods.

```javascript
// Creating an object literal
const myObject = {
  sayHello: function () {
    console.log('hello');
  },

  myName: 'Rebecca',
};

myObject.sayHello(); // "hello"
console.log(myObject.myName); // "Rebecca"

```

When creating object literals, note that the key portion of each key-value pair can be written as any valid JavaScript identifier, a string (wrapped in quotes), or a number:

```javascript
const someString = 'some string';

const myObject2 = {
  validIdentifier: 123,
  someString: 456,
  99999: 789,
};

console.log(myObject2);
```

##Exercise: Objects

Create a file called 'objects.js' your current project and bring in the first code fragment in this page and run it. Then do the following:

- Introduce a new field into the object called 'email'. 
- Initialise the email to some valid address 
- Make the 'hello' function also print out the email address as well as the name.

Using this code as a guide, create a new object call `myLocation`. It should have location-name, latitude, longitude and description as its fields. It should then have a method 'showLocation' to log the current location to the console.
