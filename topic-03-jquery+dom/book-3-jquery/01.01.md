#index1.html / dom-manip-1.js

In Webstorm, create new empty project called jquery-intro. Bring in the `.jscsrc` file as in the previous labs, and make sure the code inspections are enabled.

Introduce this file 

##index1.html
~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> JQuery Experiments </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="demo">Click the button to change this text.</p>
    <button onclick="domAccess()">Try it</button>
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="js/dom-manip-1.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

Add the following file to the project (in the `js` subdirectory):


## dom-manip-1.js

~~~
function domAccess() {
  document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hi ICTSkills';
}
~~~
Open *dom-access.html* in Chrome browser.

- You should be presented with something similar to that depicted in Figure 1.

![Figure 1: Invitation to click](img/01.png)

- Click the button *Try it*.
    - The  text *Click the button to change this text* should be replaced with:
    - Hi ICTSkills (Figure 2).

![Figure 2: Hi ICTSkills](img/02.png)

Let's use Google Chrome debugger to better understand what's happening:

- Open *dom-access.html* in Chrome.
- Select *Tools | Developer Tools* in the context menu: see Figugre 3.
![Figure 3: Launching Developer Tools](img/03.png)

- Select the file *dom-access.js* into the text window (see Figure 4).
![Figure 4: Select dom-access.js](img/04.png)

- The file *dom-access.js* should now be visible as shown in Figure 5.
![Figure 5: dom-access.js javaScript file](img/05.png)

Place a breakpoint on line 3, the statement *document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hi ICTSkills";*

- You may do this by simply placing the mouse pointer on the number 3 and clicking. See Figure 6.
![Figure 6: Breakpoint set](img/06.png)

- Reload the page and press the button **Try it**
    - As shown in Figure 7, the program stops at line 3, the breakpoint.
![Figure 7: Program halts at breakpoint](img/07.png)

How does this happen?

- When, during the loading of the page described in the file *dom-access.html*, the statement `<script src="js/dom-access.js"\></script\>` is encountered, the JavaScript file *dom-access.js*, located in the folder *js*, is incorporated into the page and the *document.getElementById* command executed.
    - This accesses the paragraph node in the DOM whose *id* is *demo* and replaces the text with *Hi ICTSkills*.

Let's now replace the native JavaScript with jQuery to achieve the same goal.

- Replace the the function *domAccess* in with the following:

## dom-manip-1.js

~~~
function domAccess() {
  $('#demo').html('Hi ICTSkills');
}

~~~

- Reload the index1.html
- Press the **Try it** button:
    - Opps! There's a problem. The text does not change. 
        - The reason is that we have not loaded the jQuery library. 
        - We can load a local or a cloud copy of jQuery. Let's do the latter. 
        - The modified html follows: reload this file, press the **Try it** button and observe that the result should be exactly the same as before: the text changes to *Hi ICTSkills*.

## index1.html

~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title> JQuery Experiments </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p id="demo">Click the button to change this text.</p>
    <button onclick="domAccess()">Try it</button>
    <script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="js/dom-manip-1.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
~~~

Study the jQuery syntax.

- $("#demo").html("Hi ICTSkills");
    - \#demo refers to the *id* in the html paragraph node
        - Observe that a hash (\#) is prepended to the id as shown in the html file.
    - $("#demo") is a jQuery object
    - $("#demo").html(...): here a jQuery method *html(...)* is being invoked on the jQuery object.
        - The text parameter in *html(...)* replaces the existing text at the location identified by the id *\#demo*.
