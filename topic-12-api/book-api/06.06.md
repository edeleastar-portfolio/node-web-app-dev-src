# Testing the Endpoints: TDD Tools

Although Postman is useful for exploratory development, developing APIs requires a more robust testing strategy. This is the realm of Test Driven Development:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>

Facilitated by specialized tools and techniques. The most fundamental set of tools are based around the so-called `X-Unit` pattern:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit>

We are going to use these two X-Unit related tools:

- <https://mochajs.org/>
- <http://chaijs.com/>

To use these tools, we need install both extensions to our WebStorm IDE and also the appropriate javascript libraries.

Mocha support should already be part of your WebStorm installation:

We will explore this in a moment.

To make use of TDD in our app, we need to instal the mocha and chai modules:

~~~
npm install mocha -save-dev
npm install chai -save-dev
~~~

Node the `-save-dev` switch. This establishes the libraries as development, not production, libraries - required only for dev/test purposes. 

Package.json includes these references in a separate section:
