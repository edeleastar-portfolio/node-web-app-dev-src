## Exercise 1: Login Feature in DonationService

Implement in `DonationService` a login feature, which checks the username/password against the fixtures we have already loaded in this class. Only allow the user to progress to logged in status if there is a valid entry

## Exercise 2: Signup UI + Feature

Implement a signup viewmodel, which will add a user to the `DonationService` users array. This view should be visible when the user presses a 'signup' option on the menu. This will take some work, as we want either the login view OR the signup view to appear. Subsequently, once logged in, we wish neither view to be visible.
