## Note on browser choice for demonstrating XSS

Recent browser versions have included some basic protections against XSS. You may need to turn this off (temporarily!) to try out these examples. 

* <b>Chrome</b>: you can turn off XSS filtering by starting Chrome (as Administrator) from a command prompt with the option **--disable-xss-auditor**
* <b>Internet Explorer</b>: You can turn off XSS filtering at **Tools**->**Internet Options**->**Security** (tab)->**Custom Level...**->**Disable XSS filter** (near the bottom of the list).
* <b>Firefox</b>: Our examples should work without any modification to Firefox settings
