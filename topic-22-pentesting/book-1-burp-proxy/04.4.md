# Intercept requests

<b>Request</b> interception is turned <b>on</b> by default.

Each time your browser issues a HTTP request it will be stopped at the proxy and you have the option to Forward or Drop it.

When you visit a HTTPS site, Firefox will complain about an untrusted TLS certificate. This is because Burp Suite generates its own certificate and replaces the target site's real certificate with this one (i.e. a MITM attack).  You can proceed anyway (with most websites) by confirming the exception.

Depending on config settings, most modern browsers maintain a dialogue with their "base". For example you may see frequent requests to domains like detectportal.firefox.com or advertisement sites. You can tune intercept options so that you don't have to deal with these.
