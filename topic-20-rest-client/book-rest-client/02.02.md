# Model Classes

##app.donation.model

In donation-service-test, create a new package called 'app.donation.model'. Incorporate the following two classes into this package:

##User

~~~
package app.donation.model;

public class User
{
  public String  _id;
  public String firstName;
  public String lastName;
  public String email;
  public String password;

  public User(String firstName, String lastName, String email, String password)
  {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.email = email;
    this.password = password;
  }
}
~~~

##Candidate

~~~
package app.donation.model;

public class Candidate
{
  public String   _id;
  public String firstName;
  public String lastName;
  public String office;

  public Candidate(String firstName, String lastName, String office)
  {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.office = office;
  }
}

~~~

###Donation

~~~
package app.donation.model;

public class Donation
{
  public String   _id;
  public int    amount;
  public String method;

  public Donation (int amount, String method)
  {
    this.amount = amount;
    this.method = method;
  }
}
~~~

These are java versions of the Mongoose javascript models we have developed in donaiton-web. Compare them now - can you see any differences?

In particular, look closely at Donation.
