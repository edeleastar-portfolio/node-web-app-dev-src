#Creating Donations


Try this at the end of the main method:

~~~
    Donation donation = new Donation(5000, "paypal");
    service.createDonation(candidates.get(0), donation);
    donations = service.getAllDonations();
    println ("--------------------");
    println ("  all donations with a new donation created: ");
    println ("--------------------");
    println(donations);
~~~

We are trying to create a donation. Our output should show the new donation at the end:

~~~
  {
    "_id": "5815a8bf0dc72a79a540cf20",
    "amount": 5000,
    "method": "paypal"
  }
~~~

Check the web app to see if it was created.
