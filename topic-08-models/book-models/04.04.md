# Introduce User Model

Introducing models into an application is a key step in may the application perform some useful function. We already have a `models` folder in our app - create a new module to represent a Schema for a User model:

##app/models/user.js

~~~
'use strict';

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: String,
  lastName: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
module.exports = User;

~~~

The accounts controller can now require this model:

##app/controllers/accounts.js

~~~
const User = require('../models/user');
~~~

.. and in register we can save new users as they are registered:

~~~
exports.register = {
  auth: false,
  handler: function (request, reply) {
    const user = new User(request.payload);

    user.save().then(newUser => {
      reply.redirect('/login');
    }).catch(err => {
      reply.redirect('/');
    });
  },

};
~~~

Run the app now and register a new user. In Robomongo, make sure you can browse to the collection we have just created (you may need to refresh the view to see the updates)

The authenticate method will also need to be updated to consult the database when validating a user:

~~~
exports.authenticate = {
  auth: false,
  handler: function (request, reply) {
    const user = request.payload;
    User.findOne({ email: user.email }).then(foundUser => {
      if (foundUser && foundUser.password === user.password) {
        request.cookieAuth.set({
          loggedIn: true,
          loggedInUser: user.email,
        });
        reply.redirect('/home');
      } else {
        reply.redirect('/signup');
      }
    }).catch(err => {
      reply.redirect('/');
    });
  },

};
~~~

Try this now and verify that you can sign up, login and logout. Other aspects of the app are broken though.

You may notice the following on the console:

~~~
node:50475) DeprecationWarning: Mongoose: mpromise (mongoose's default promise library) is deprecated, plug in your own promise library instead: http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html
~~~

We are using a `promise` syntax for database query and update - however the default promise support we are using is not intended for long term use. 

- <http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html>

We can turn on native ES6 promises instead, removing the warning. Place the following line in db.js:

# app/models/db.js

~~~
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
~~~

Place this just after mongoose is initialised:

~~~
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;
~~~
