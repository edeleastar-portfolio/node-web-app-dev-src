# Display Donor Email in Donations

We have lost the 'donor' column in the report field - as we are not recording this in the model yet.

Make this change to the donation schema model to store some information about the donor:

## app/models/donation.js

~~~
const donationSchema = mongoose.Schema({
  amount: Number,
  method: String,
  donor: String,
});
~~~


When we create a donation, we will insert the currents users email as the donor:

## app/controllers/donations.js

~~~
    let data = request.payload;
    data.donor = request.auth.credentials.loggedInUser;
    const donation = new Donation(data);
~~~

Finally, in our `donationlist` partial, display the donor string:

~~~
          {{#each donations}}
            <tr>
              <td> {{amount}} </td>
              <td> {{method}} </td>
              <td> {{donor}}  </td>
            </tr>
          {{/each}}
~~~

Run the app now and verify that the donors email is displayed (and stored). Note that the new donation model happily co-exists with the previous version.
