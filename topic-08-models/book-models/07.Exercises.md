##Exercise 1: Settings

The settings view is currently not functioning, as it is still tied to an earlier mechanism for tracking users:

~~~
exports.viewSettings = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    var userEmail = request.auth.credentials.loggedInUser;
    var currentUserDetails = this.users[userEmail];
    reply.view('settings', { title: 'Edit Account Settings', user: currentUserDetails });
  },

};

exports.updateSettings = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    const user = request.payload;
    this.users[user.email] = user;
    reply.redirect('/settings');
  },

};
~~~


##Hints

### viewSettings

This should be straightforward to correct. This line no longer makes sense:

~~~
    var currentUserDetails = this.users[userEmail];
~~~

Instead, we need to read from the database to get the user details, and then render these to the view (sending the user to the start page if there is an error):

~~~
    User.findOne({ email: userEmail }).then(foundUser => {
      reply.view('settings', { title: 'Edit Account Settings', user: foundUser });
    }).catch(err => {
      reply.redirect('/');
    });
~~~

### updateSettings

This is more complicated - as we need to read a users details from the database, and then update with new values entered by the user. Here is a fragment that will accomplish this (without error handling) :

~~~
    User.findOne({ email: loggedInUserEmail }).then(user => {
      user.firstName = editedUser.firstName;
      user.lastName = editedUser.lastName;
      user.email = editedUser.email;
      user.password = editedUser.password;
      return user.save();
    }).then(user => {
      reply.view('settings', { title: 'Edit Account Settings', user: user });
    });
~~~

Note that we return a promise from the `save()` function - and then re render the updated user details to the settings view.
