# Comprehensive Candidate Tests

With fixtures and an simplified comparison capability mow in place, we can proceed to evolve a more comprehensive set of tests.

First we need to provide support for the `delete` operations in our encapsulated layers:

## sync-http-client.js

~~~
  delete (url) {
    var res = request('DELETE', this.baseUrl + url);
    return res.statusCode;
  }
~~~

## donation-service.js

~~~
  deleteAllCandidates() {
    return this.httpService.delete('/api/candidates');
  }

  deleteOneCandidate(id) {
    return this.httpService.delete('/api/candidates/' + id);
  }
~~~

Now we write a new test to verify delete:

~~~
 test('delete a candidate', function () {
    const c = donationService.createCandidate(newCandidate);
    assert(donationService.getCandidate(c._id) != null);
    donationService.deleteOneCandidate(c._id);
    assert(donationService.getCandidate(c._id) == null);
  });
~~~

This seems like an easy test - create a candidate, delete it, and then attempt to retrieve the deleted candidate using the id. It should pass. However, we get the following error reported in the test runnner:

~~~
SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input
    at Object.parse (native)
    at SyncHttpService.get (test/sync-http-client.js:13:26)
    at DonationService.getCandidate (test/donation-service.js:17:29)
    at Context.<anonymous> (test/candidateapitest.js:35:28)
~~~

This seems to be a failure in our utility classes, not in the donation-web server. However, on closer inspection it is in fact a failure in the donation-web application itself. Specifically in our `candidatesapi` method:

~~~
exports.findOne = {

  auth: false,

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    Candidate.findOne({ _id: request.params.id }).then(candidate => {
        reply(candidate);
    }).catch(err => {
      reply(Boom.notFound('id not found'));
    });
  },

};
~~~

This looks ok, and if we try an arbitrary request:

- <http://localhost:4000/api/candidates/1234>

Then it will seem to work ok:

~~~
{
  statusCode: 404,
  error: "Not Found",
  message: "id not found"
}
~~~

However, this masks a serious error - try this request in a browser:

- <http://localhost:4000/api/candidates/012345678901234567890123>

This is a concocted id, but the request is succeeding, but returning null. This is what is causing our utilities to generate an error in the test client.

Here is an alternative version of findOne to fix this issue:

~~~
exports.findOne = {

  auth: false,

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    Candidate.findOne({ _id: request.params.id }).then(candidate => {
      if (candidate != null) {
        reply(candidate);
      }

      reply(Boom.notFound('id not found'));
    }).catch(err => {
      reply(Boom.notFound('id not found'));
    });
  },

};
~~~


the findOne query will generate an exception if the key is an invalid length, but will return a null object if it fails to find a matching object for a correctly formed key.

The above demonstrates they type of errors / misunderstanding that more thorough tests will uncover.

There is a corresponding method on `app/api/usersapi.js' that must also be fixed:

~~~
exports.findOne = {

  auth: false,

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    User.findOne({ _id: request.params.id }).then(user => {
      if (user != null) {
        reply(user);
      }

      reply(Boom.notFound('id not found'));
    }).catch(err => {
      reply(Boom.notFound('id not found'));
    });
  },

};
~~~
