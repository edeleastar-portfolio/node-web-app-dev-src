#Install Joi plugin

Currently we do very little validation in the app. If the user enters invalid or inappropriate values in our forms we are not really alerting the user to correct their entries, or what constitutes a valid entry for a given field.

HAPI has a plugin to help solve this problem:

- <https://github.com/hapijs/joi>

Like all pligins, we install it in the usual way:

~~~
npm install joi -save
~~~
