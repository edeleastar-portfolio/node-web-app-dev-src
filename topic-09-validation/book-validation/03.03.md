# Populate Donor Object in Donation Query

## app/views/partials/donation.hbs

Having established an object reference, we might like to display the full name of the donor in the report view:

~~~
          {{#each donations}}
            <tr>
              <td> {{amount}} </td>
              <td> {{method}} </td>
              <td> {{donor.firstName}} {{donor.lastName}} </td>
            </tr>
          {{/each}}
~~~

Run the app again  - and inspect the report view. The donor column will be blank however. This is because object references are not automatically retrieved so our form draws a blank on the donor object. 

## app/controllers/donation.js

So here is minor update to the report handler - with a `populate('donor')` call inserted into the query:

~~~
exports.report = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    Donation.find({}).populate('donor').then(allDonations => {
      reply.view('report', {
        title: 'Donations to Date',
        donations: allDonations,
      });
    }).catch(err => {
      reply.redirect('/');
    });
  },

};
~~~

This will ensure that the donor object will be retrieve on the single query - and thus our donor object should successfully resolve in the form.

Try this now and verify that the donor's full name is displayed in the report view.

You may notice that it does not work on the first attempt - as your Mongo database may have older version of the donation object in the donations collection. These older reference do not have the donor id as a field, and hence the above query will throw an exception. Delete all your donations objects completed, and the app should run correctly.
