# Requirements

Specify requirements for a software system of your choice. Make sure that it is simple enough to be specified fully in one or two pages of requirements, but sophisticated enough to be interesting â€“ i.e. there should be at least two different types of user (actors); there should be a variety of functions, some of which are restricted to certain users; some of the functions should be multi-step (for example, a transaction might combine an order function with a payment function). You may think in terms of an application you have developed yourself (perhaps enhanced a bit) or something completely different.

This should be done in text, using bulleted or numbered lists as appropriate.
