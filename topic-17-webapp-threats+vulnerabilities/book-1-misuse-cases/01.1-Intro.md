## Threat modelling using misuse cases

Several software vulnerabilities are caused by poor specification of requirements, poor design and/or poor testing rather than specific programming flaws. It is important to consider security at all stages of the software development lifecycle.

For the purpose of the assignment, you are asked to specify and analyse requirements for a software system of your choice. Besides specifying basic functionality, you should concentrate on security requirements and use threat modelling to help put together those requirements. In particular you should specify what are known as misuse cases (also called abuse cases).
