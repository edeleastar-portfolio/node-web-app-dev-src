# Algorithm Performance Testing (Optional)

In this step, you will benchmark the performance of various encryption algorithms on your machine.

* Create or locate a large test file, say 1GB - [link to sample 1GB file](http://ftp.heanet.ie/pub/ubuntu-cdimage/releases/14.04.5/release/ubuntu-14.04.5-desktop-amd64+mac.iso).

* Record how much time it takes to encrypt it using various encryption algorithms . Which is fastest? To do this, use the time command, which is simply prefixed to the command you are running, like this:
~~~
time openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -e -kfile key128 -in plaintext.zip -out /dev/null
~~~
<pre>
&nbsp;real  0m0.736s
&nbsp;user  0m0.576s
&nbsp;sys   0m0.057s
</pre>
(the sum of *user* and *sys* time is what matters)<br><br>
Ideally, take each time measurement a few times (say 3 times) and exclude any that are noticeably slower than the others (to reduce impact of short-term processor activity from running programs).<br><br>

* If you have time, see how the performance of RSA public key encryption compares to the symmetric algorithms above. How about the performance of RSA key generation (try large RSA keys â€“ e.g. 2048/4096/8192 bits)?
