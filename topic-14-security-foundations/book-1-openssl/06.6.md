# Hash functions

A cryptographic hash function is used to provide message integrity. A signed hash is often also used for message authentication. Hash functions are one-way functions that provide a fixed-sized output, regardless of the size of the input.

* Create a test file containing some text.<br><br>

* Using OpenSSL, find MD5, SHA1 and SHA-256 hash values for this file.  Verify the number of bits generated in each case. 
To find the SHA-1 hash of a file called testfile.txt, you would enter:
~~~
openssl dgst –sha1 testfile.txt         # SHA-1 algorithm in this example
~~~
Alternatively, you can provide the input to openssl’s standard input; e.g.:
~~~
echo -n "topsecretpassword" | openssl dgst -sha256     # SHA-256 algorithm
~~~
*(Note that the echo statement normally adds a newline character to the end of the supplied string and this would affect the hash value output. The -n switch removes this.)*<br><br>

* Modify the input very slightly and see how the hash values change.<br><br>

* Add some additional text. Do the hash values increase in size?<br><br>

* Find the hash values of some common dictionary words.  Give them to a classmate.<br><br>
 
* See if you can find a way to reverse the hashing process – i.e. get hash values from a classmate and try to find the original input. Hint: Google
