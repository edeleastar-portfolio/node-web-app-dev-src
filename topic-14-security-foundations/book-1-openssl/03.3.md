## OpenSSL Batch mode

Alternatively you can execute OpenSSL commands directly from the Linux prompt using the general command format:
~~~
openssl command [options]
~~~

Depending on the command, there may be zero or more options. For example, you could enter:
~~~
openssl version
~~~
<pre>
&nbsp;OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016
</pre>

We will use *Batch mode* in this exercise.
