# OpenSSL

OpenSSL is an open source cryptographic toolkit that implements SSL/TLS. Tools are available to carry out key generation and storage, encryption and authentication with a selection of the most widely used algorithms, the creation and management of digital certificates, and various other related activities.

OpenSSL is available from [http://www.openssl.org/](http://www.openssl.org/). OpenSSL tools are available at the command line and as an API. We will use the command-line OpenSSL tools in this exercise.
 
OpenSSL comes pre-installed with most versions of Linux and MacOS. To use it, you just need to enter the *openssl* command in a terminal. You may use an Amazon instance or your local machine.
Linux is recommended for OpenSSL but, if you prefer to work in Microsoft Windows, there is a [Windows version](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
