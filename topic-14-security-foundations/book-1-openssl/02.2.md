## OpenSSL Interactive mode

With OpenSSL, by entering the *openssl* command (with no option or arguments), the tool enters “interactive” mode; a prompt indicates that the program is ready to process standard openssl commands. Entering:
~~~
openssl
~~~
gives a prompt that looks like this:
~~~
OpenSSL >
~~~

When the execution of a command is completed, the prompt reappears, indicating that the tools is ready to execute another openssl command. OpenSSL commands can be followed by zero or more options, depending on the command and how it is used. 

You can exit from the command-line tool by executing: 
~~~
OpenSSL > quit
~~~

You can see what version of OpenSSL is installed by going back into interactive mode and entering:
~~~
OpenSSL > version
~~~
<pre>
&nbsp;OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016
</pre>

You can get a list of OpenSSL commands by entering any invalid command, or by reading the online [OpenSSL documentation online](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manpages.html).
