# MongoLab

Create a free account here:

- <https://mlab.com>

Once you have successfully logged in, create a new MongoDB deployment called `donation`:

Inspect the database:

and in the users tab, create a new user for this database. Use 'donationuser' for the username and password.

Note carefully the connection string at the top of the page:

~~~
 mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds052323.mlab.com:1234/donation
~~~

You will need to formulate a connection string using the `donationuser` you have just created. It might look like this:

~~~
 mongodb://donationuser:donationuser@ds055626.mlab.com:55626/donation
~~~

(not exactly the above as you will have different server/port addresses etc..)

To test this connection string out, look again at our db.js module:

## app/models/db.js

~~~
...
var dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost/donation';
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  dbURI = process.env.MONGODB_URI;
}
...
~~~

Purely as a temporary measure, change the dbURI initlisation to use your connection string:

~~~
var dbURI = 'mongodb://donationuser:donationuser@ds0XXXX.mlab.com:XXXX/donation';
~~~

Restart the app, and see if it launches successfully. As you register users / make donations, observe the database on MongoLab. You should see the collections being populated on that service.

If it works, then change it back to what it was, but keep the connection string (as a comment for the moment).
