# Heroku

Verify that the following command responds with a recent version number:

~~~
heroku --version
~~~

Now log in to your heroku account:

~~~
heroku login
Email: 
Password (typing will be hidden):
~~~

Once logged in, create a new application on heroku

~~~
heroku create
~~~

This will respond with a new name in a few seconds:

~~~
Creating app... â¬¢ calm-brushlands-29225
https://calm-brushlands-29225.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/calm-brushlands-29225.git
~~~

The two urls reported are the domain to access the app on (you will need this in a moment), and also the remote git repository where the source of your app pulled from during deployment.

On the web, you can check to see if the app is present on your dashboard:

- <https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps>

Explore the dashboard for the app for a few minutes. We havent deployed it yet however.
