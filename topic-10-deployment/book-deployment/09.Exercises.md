In order to gain some practice with deployment, make a copy of your project into another folder and deploy it as a separate application on heroku from the app deployed on this lab.

When you have duplicated the app - and before you start this lab again - delete the `.git` folder from the copy, as this lab assumes you are starting from a project not committed to git.
