# Production Mode DB URI

Although the app will launch, we will not be able to get beyond the sign up screen. Trying to register a new user will generate an internal error on the app.

It can be challenging to debug these errors without access to the log. From within the project folder, enter the following command:

~~~
heroku logs --tail
~~~

This will give us a live log in the console. Probing this a little deeper, we see the reason why the app is failing:

~~~

We dont seem to be connecting to the database correctly.

Looking at `db.js`, we can see the source of the problem.

~~~
var dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost/donation';
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  dbURI = process.env.MONGOLAB_URI;
}
~~~

The app is not connecting to the correct database. To fix this, we need to do two things:

- (1) Set the app to 'production' mode
- (2) Set the string `MONGOLAB_URI` to our database on mongoLab

## 1: Enable production mode:

On the command line, in your app folder enter:

~~~
heroku config:set NODE_ENV="production"
~~~

This should respond with:

~~~
Setting NODE_ENV and restarting â¬¢ agile-depths-49364... done, v4
NODE_ENV: production
~~~

## 2: Setting the MongoLab connection string:

Also on the command line, in your app folder enter:

~~~
heroku config:set MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://donationuser:donationuser@dsXXX.mlab.com:XXXX/donation
~~~

(use the string from your app in step 4)

Now restart the app:

~~~
heroku restart
~~~

We should be able to fully exercise the application now. Keep an eye on the log window if you have it still open.
