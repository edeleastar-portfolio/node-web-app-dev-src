# Configuration - donation-client and donation-web

We need some preparatory steps before trying to contacting the donation-web api from donation-client.

# donation-client

Aurelia has some convenient http components:

- <http://aurelia.io/hub.html#/doc/article/aurelia/fetch-client/latest/http-services/3>

This is not included by default - and will need to be installed. Installing additional components is a two step process:

## Step 1: Install the component via npm

~~~
npm install aurelia-http-client -save
~~~

This will install the module into our local `node-modules` folder.

## Step 2: Incorporate into Aurelia client build

This must be manual inserted into the following configuration file:

## aurelia_project/aurelia.json

~~~
     "dependencies": [
          ...
          "aurelia-history-browser",
          "aurelia-http-client",
          "aurelia-loader",
          ...
~~~

When this is complete, make sure to rebuild the app:

~~~
au run --watch
~~~

# donation-web

This is the most recent donation-web project:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/donation-web/releases/tag/lab.14.exercises>

Access to the donation-web api may be restricted if we are attempting access from another domain. This is the Cross Origin Sharing issue, discussed here:

- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing>

and 

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS>

If we wish our app to be accessible from an SPA, then we may need to explicitly enable it. This package here can make it easier:

- <https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi-cors>

First install it (remember, we are now working in `donation-web`, not `donation-client`)

~~~
npm install hapi-cors-headers -save
~~~

Then in index.html, import it:

## index.js

~~~
const corsHeaders = require('hapi-cors-headers');
~~~

Finally, we can enable the facility, with the default options:

~~~
...
  server.ext('onPreResponse', corsHeaders);
  server.route(require('./routes'));
  server.route(require('./routesapi'));
...
~~~
