Archive of the lab so far:

## donation-client

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/donation-client/releases/tag/aurelia.4.end>


## Exercise 1: Retrieve prior donations

When you first log in, modify app such that existing donations are retrieved from donation-web. Currently we only show donations made my the current user.

## Exercise 2: Show Candidate names in report 

Notice that, when you make a donation - the actual candidate's name does not appear. Why is this? In chrome, debug into the app to explore why. See if you can fix this. 

There are two approaches:

- You already know the candidate name in the donation-client, so just insert it into the donation.
- Change donation-web to populate the donation's candidate field when you create a donation.
