# donation-service - Login

We can now try first contact from the donation-client to donation-web. Make sure donation-web is running.

## src/services/donation-service.js


First modify the constructor to load the async-client we have just introduced + remove the loading of data from the fixtures:

~~~
...
import AsyncHttpClient from './async-http-client';

@inject(Fixtures, EventAggregator, AsyncHttpClient)
export default class DonationService {

  donations = [];
  methods = [];
  candidates = [];
  users = [];
  total = 0;

  constructor(data, ea, ac) {
    this.methods = data.methods;
    this.ea = ea;
    this.ac = ac;
    this.getCandidates();
    this.getUsers();
  }
~~~

In the above constructor - note that we are calling two new methods. These will retrieve the users and candidates list from donation-web:

~~~
  getCandidates() {
    this.ac.get('/api/candidates').then(res => {
      this.candidates = res.content;
    });
  }

  getUsers() {
    this.ac.get('/api/users').then(res => {
      this.users = res.content;
    });
  }
~~~

Now we can rewrite `login` to authenticate using the retrieved users list.

~~~
  login(email, password) {
    const status = {
      success: false,
      message: 'Login Attempt Failed'
    };
    for (let user of this.users) {
      if (user.email === email && user.password === password) {
        status.success = true;
        status.message = 'logged in';
      }
    }
    this.ea.publish(new LoginStatus(status));
  }
~~~

Try all this now - you should be able to log in with a user credentials as stored on the server. Also, you should be retrieving the candidate list from donation-web.

Do not proceed till the next step unless you have confirmed the above.
