# Lab Aurelia 4 Exercise Solutions

## Exercises 1: Stats Viewmodel

Run the app and look at the stats view. It seems to be perpetually set to 0. Why is this? Can you find a way of it displaying the correct view?


## Solution

This is a revised implementation of stats.js, which handles the `attached` event. This is triggered when the component becomes active. We retrieve the current value from the donation-serivce at this this point.

~~~
import {inject} from 'aurelia-framework';
import {TotalUpdate} from '../../services/messages';
import {EventAggregator} from 'aurelia-event-aggregator';
import DonationService from '../../services/donation-service';

@inject(EventAggregator, DonationService)
export class Stats {

  total = 0;

  constructor(ea, ds) {
    this.ds = ds;
    ea.subscribe(TotalUpdate, msg => {
      this.total = msg.total;
    });
  }

  attached() {
    this.total = this.ds.total;
  }
}

~~~


In particular, the `attached` event/method.

## Exercise 2: Composite View/Viewmodel.

Build a new view/view model - to appear on the menu as 'dashboard' - which combines all existing views/viewmodels

## Solution

## src/viewmodels/dashboard/dashboard.html

~~~
<template>
  <section class="ui grid segment">
    <div class="four wide column">
      <compose view-model="../donate/donate"></compose>
    </div>
    <div class="four wide column">
      <compose class="four wide column" view-model="../report/report"></compose>
    </div>
    <div class="four wide column">
      <compose class="four wide column" view-model="../candidates/candidates"></compose>
    </div>
    <div class="four wide  column">
      <compose class="ui column" view-model="../stats/stats"></compose>
    </div>
  </section>
</template>
~~~

## src/viewmodels/dashboard/dashboard.js

~~~
export class Dashboard {
}
~~~

## src/home.js

~~~
  ...
    { route: 'dashboard', name: 'dashboard', moduleId: 'viewmodels/dashboard/dashboard', nav: true, title: 'Dashboard' },
  ...
~~~
