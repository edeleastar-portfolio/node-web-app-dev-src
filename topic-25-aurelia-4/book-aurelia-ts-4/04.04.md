# donation-service - Login

We can now try first contact from the donation-client to donation-web. Make sure donation-web is running.

## src/services/donation-service.js


First modify the constructor to load the async-client we have just introduced + remove the loading of data from the fixtures:

~~~
...
import AsyncHttpClient from './async-http-client';
...

@inject(Fixtures, EventAggregator, AsyncHttpClient)
export class DonationService {
  ea: EventAggregator;
  ac: AsyncHttpClient;
  donations: Array<Donation> = [];
  methods: Array<string> = [];
  candidates: Array<Candidate> = [];
  users: Map<string, User> = new Map();
  total = 0;

  constructor(data: Fixtures, ea: EventAggregator, ac: AsyncHttpClient) {
    this.methods = data.methods;
    this.ea = ea;
    this.ac = ac;
    this.getCandidates();
    this.getUsers();
  }
~~~

In the above constructor - note that we are calling two new methods. These will retrieve the users and candidates list from donation-web:

~~~
  getCandidates() {
    this.ac.get('/api/candidates').then(res => {
      this.candidates = res.content;
    });
  }

  getUsers() {
      this.ac.get('/api/users').then(res => {
        const users = res.content as Array<User>;
        users.forEach(user => {
          this.users.set(user.email, user);
        });
      });
  }
~~~


Try all this now - you should be able to log in with a user credentials as stored on the server. Also, you should be retrieving the candidate list from donation-web.

Do not proceed till the next step unless you have confirmed the above.
