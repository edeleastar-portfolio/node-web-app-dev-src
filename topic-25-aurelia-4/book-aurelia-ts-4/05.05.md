# donation-service - Donate

We can now have a go at creating a donation:

## src/donation-service/DonationService.js

~~~
  donate(amount: number, method: string, candidate: Candidate) {
    const donation = {
      amount: amount,
      method: method,
    };
    this.ac
      .post('/api/candidates/' + candidate._id + '/donations', donation)
      .then(res => {
        let returnedDonation = res.content as Donation;
        returnedDonation.candidate = candidate;
        this.donations.push(returnedDonation);
        console.log(
          `${amount} donated to ${candidate.firstName} ${
            candidate.lastName
          } : ${method}`,
        );

        this.total = this.total + amount;
        console.log('Total so far ' + this.total);
        this.ea.publish(new TotalUpdate(this.total));
      });
  }
~~~

Not a major change - and notice we do not need to change any of out view-models. They are data-bound to our donation-service, and we are now updating this with donation we have retrieved from the server.

Make sure this works before proceeding to the next step. Check the donation-web UI and verify the donations are getting through.
