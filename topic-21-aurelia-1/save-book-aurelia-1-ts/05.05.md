# DonationService

Ultimately we will be interacting the donation-web API in this app. In preparation for this, we introduce a class to represent the API in the client. 

We start with a simple client-side model of the Candidates:


## src/services/candidate.ts

~~~
export class Candidate {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

export const candidates: Array<Candidate> = [
  {
    firstName: 'Lisa',
    lastName: 'Simpson',
  },
  {
    firstName: 'Bart',
    lastName: 'Simpson',
  },
];
~~~

Were we are declaring a simple Candidate class + and array of candidates. Both are being exported from the module.

Introduce this class now:

## src/services/donation-service.js

~~~
import {Candidate, candidates} from "./candidate";

export default class DonationService {
  donations = [];
  methods = ['Cash', 'PayPal'];
  selectedCandidate = candidates[0];

  donate(amount: Number, method: String, candidate: Candidate) {
    let donation = {
      amount: amount,
      method: method,
      candidate: candidate,
    };
    this.donations.push(donation);
    console.log(
      `${amount} donated to ${candidate.firstName} ${candidate.lastName} ${
        method
      }`,
    );
  }
}

~~~

This is a simple class - with no view aspects - that represents the API with a single 'donate' method.

Rewrite the donate view model class now to use this service:

## src/components/donate.js

~~~
import { inject } from 'aurelia-framework';
import DonationService from '../services/donation-service';
import { Candidate, candidates } from '../services/candidate';

@inject(DonationService)
export class Donate {
  donationService: DonationService;
  amount = 0;
  methods = [];
  selectedMethod = '';
  selectedCandidate: Candidate;
  candidates: Array<Candidate>;

  constructor(ds) {
    this.donationService = ds;
    this.methods = ds.methods;
    this.selectedMethod = this.methods[0];
    this.candidates = candidates;
    this.selectedCandidate = this.candidates[0];
  }

  makeDonation() {
    this.donationService.donate(
      this.amount,
      this.selectedMethod,
      this.selectedCandidate,
    );
  }
}
~~~

We are using Aurelia Dependency Injection to locate a reference to the service object, and in our constructor we are binding the visual components directly to service data structures.

This should now be running as before - there is no change to the html template.

## Fixtures

To keep the donation-service class clean, we can load candidates and methods (and sample donations) from an external file.

## src/services/fixtures.js

~~~
export default class Fixtures {

  methods = ['Cash', 'PayPal'];

  candidates = [
    {
      firstName: 'Lisa',
      lastName: 'Simpson'
    },
    {
      firstName: 'Bart',
      lastName: 'Simpson'
    }
  ];

  donations = [
    {
      amount: 23,
      method: 'cash',
      candidate: this.candidates[0]
    },
    {
      amount: 212,
      method: 'paypal',
      candidate: this.candidates[1]
    }
  ];
}
~~~

This is a refactored donation-service to load this data:

~~~
import {inject} from 'aurelia-framework';
import Fixtures from './fixtures';

@inject(Fixtures)
export default class DonationService {

  donations = [];
  methods = [];
  candidates = [];

  constructor(data) {
    this.donations = data.donations;
    this.candidates = data.candidates;
    this.methods = data.methods;
  }

  donate(amount, method, candidate) {
    const donation = {
      amount: amount,
      method: method,
      candidate: candidate
    };
    this.donations.push(donation);
    console.log(amount + ' donated to ' + candidate.firstName + ' ' + candidate.lastName + ': ' + method);
  }
}
~~~

All should work as before.
