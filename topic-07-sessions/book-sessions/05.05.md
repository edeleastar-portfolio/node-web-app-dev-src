# Cookie Retrieval

Our app now functions (after a fashion). However, we have lost the donor from the donations list. We can fix this now and use the cookie to recover the logged in user details

##donations.js

Here is a revised version of the donate route:

~~~
exports.donate = {

  handler: function (request, reply) {
    let data = request.payload;
    var donorEmail = request.auth.credentials.loggedInUser;
    data.donor = this.users[donorEmail];
    this.donations.push(data);
    reply.redirect('/report');
  },

};
~~~

The key changes are here:

~~~
    var donorEmail = request.auth.credentials.loggedInUser;
    data.donor = this.users[donorEmail];
~~~

We recover the donor email from the cookie - and look up our local database of users to recover the users details. We store that with the donation as before.

Restart the app now, sign up and log in. The donations should be listed with the donors details.
