# Redirect protected Routes to Login Page

Currently if we are not logged in, and we attempt to visit a guarded route, we get this response:

~~~
{
  statusCode: 401,
  error: "Unauthorized",
  message: "Missing authentication"
}
~~~

This will also be the response if the cookie expires, or is deleted. Try deleting the cookie (using chrome, after you have logged in) and see if this is in fact the case.

A better user experience would be to redirect the user to the login page.

## index.js

We can do this as an additional parameter when the strategy is being defined:

~~~
    redirectTo: '/login',
~~~

Place the above as an additional paramater:

~~~
  server.auth.strategy('standard', 'cookie', {
    password: 'secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone',
    cookie: 'donation-cookie',
    isSecure: false,
    ttl: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
    redirectTo: '/login',
  });
~~~

Restart the app now, and try to directly visit some of the protected routes:

- <http://localhost:4000/report>
- <http://localhost:4000/home>

NB: If you did not log out before you restarted the app, then the above routes will seem to work - even if you did not log in! This is because the session may still be active. Delete the session using chrome web developer tools, restart the app and try the above routes again. This time you should be redirected to the login page.
