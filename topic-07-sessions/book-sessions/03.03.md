# Default Strategy + open accounts routes

If we now set up this as the strategy for all routes:


## index.js

~~~
server.auth.default({
  strategy: 'standard',
});
~~~

Place the above just after the strategy is defined in index.

Restart the application. Now try to visit the app in a browser in the usual way. This time the app will be disabled:

~~~
{
  statusCode: 401,
  error: "Unauthorized",
  message: "Missing authentication"
}
~~~

.. as we have protected all routes with the `standard` security strategy.

Clearly this is not what we intended. Lets reopen the `home` page, disabling the strategy for just that route:

## accounts.js

~~~
exports.main = {
  auth: false,
  handler: function (request, reply) {
    reply.view('main', { title: 'Welcome to Donations' });
  },

};
~~~

Restart the app, and you should be able to visit the home page. All the other routes should still be protected however. 

Reopen all of the `accounts` routes now by adding

~~~
  auth: false,
~~~

Now try to log in. You should be able to get passed the signup view and onto login. However, when you log in the app will give you the unauthorised response again:

~~~
{
  statusCode: 401,
  error: "Unauthorized",
  message: "Missing authentication"
}
~~~
