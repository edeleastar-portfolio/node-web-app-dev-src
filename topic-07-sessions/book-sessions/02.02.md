# Cookie Plugin Initialisation

The naive approach we have taken to tracking users us not really usable. The tracking mechanism is entirely bound within main memory, can can be easily subverted as soon as more than one connection is established to the service (try it!). We need a more robust mechanism - typically called `Session Management` - to track and follow individual users of our service.

We do this using a conventional `cookie` based approach. Much of the complexity of this is handled via a plugin, which you can install now:

~~~
npm install hapi-auth-cookie -save
~~~

Our package.json should now be:

## package.json

~~~
{
  "name": "donation-web",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "an application to host donations for candidates",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "handlebars": "^4.0.5",
    "hapi": "^14.1.0",
    "hapi-auth-cookie": "^6.1.1",
    "inert": "^4.0.1",
    "vision": "^4.1.0"
  }
}
~~~


##index.js

We will need to register the plugin:

~~~
server.register([require('inert'), require('vision'), require('hapi-auth-cookie')], err => {
~~~

... and also initialize it.

~~~
  server.auth.strategy('standard', 'cookie', {
    password: 'secretpasswordnotrevealedtoanyone',
    cookie: 'donation-cookie',
    isSecure: false,
    ttl: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  });
~~~

Place the above just before the initialization of the routes.

The paramaters set a secure password for the cookie itself, a name for the cookie and a time to live (1 day). Additionally, it is set to work over non-secure connections.

We have not engaged the security strategy yet, so there will be no effect on the app.
