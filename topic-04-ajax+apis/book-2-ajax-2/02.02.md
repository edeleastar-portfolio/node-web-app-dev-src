#Create Project

Create a new 'Empty Project' in WebStorm called js-ajax-2.

Bring in the `.jscsrc` file from th previous labs, and make sure the inspections are enabled.

Create a new file called `fs.js` with the following:

~~~
var fsConfig = {
  base_url: 'https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?',
  client_id: 'Your ID',
  client_secret: 'Your Secret',
};

console.log (fsConfig);
~~~

Run the program now by selecting the js file, right click and select `Run`

Run it again by pressing the green arrow on the toolbar.

Set a breakpoint on the console.log statement - and press the green 'bug' icon. The program should stop and you should be able to inspect the fsConfig object.
