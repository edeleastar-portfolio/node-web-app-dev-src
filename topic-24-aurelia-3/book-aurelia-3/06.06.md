# Logout

The routes we have introduced have a `logout` route defined. However we need matching view/viewmodels:

## src/viewmodels/logout/logout.html

~~~
<template>

  <form submit.delegate="logout($event)" class="ui stacked segment form">
    <h3 class="ui header">Are you sure you want to log out?</h3>
    <button class="ui blue submit button">Logout</button>
  </form>

</template>
~~~

## src/viewmodels/logout/logout.html

~~~
import DonationService from '../../services/donation-service';
import {inject} from 'aurelia-framework';

@inject(DonationService)
export class Logout {

  constructor(donationService) {
    this.donationService = donationService;
  }

  logout() {
    console.log('logging out');
    this.donationService.logout();
  }
}
~~~

All should work now - with one exception (see exercises).
