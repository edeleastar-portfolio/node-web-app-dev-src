## Password hashing & salting

The [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) module provides password hashing and salting.

When *registering* a new user or *changing* password, convert the supplied password to a hashed and salted version with <font face="Courier">bcrypt.hash</font>

~~~
bcrypt.hash(plaintextPassword, saltRounds, function(err, hash) {
   // Store hash in your password DB. 
});
~~~

To *check* a password entered by a user against the stored value, read the stored value (called **hash** here) and compare with <font face="Courier">bcrypt.compare</font>

~~~
bcrypt.compare(candidatePassword, hash, function(err, res) { 
  // res is true if password is correct
});
~~~

This [edited version of the accounts.js](archive/accounts.js) controller from [donation-web-final](https://bitbucket.org/edeleastar/donation-web-final) implements both of these for user registration, password update and authentication.

Note that any database initialisation you have will also need to be updated - see new version of [initdata.json](archive/initdata.json). These were populated with values created with an [online bcrypt calculator](https://www.dailycred.com/article/bcrypt-calculator).

The lecture notes contain some background on password hashing and salting.

You can get donation-web-final with the following command:

<pre>
git clone https://bitbucket.org/edeleastar/donation-web-final.git
</pre>

Then overwrite *app/controllers/accounts.js* with the version of *accounts.js* linked below.
Likewise overwrite *app/models/initdata.json* with the version of *initdata.json* linked below.

Start mongod in a new terminal
<pre>
sudo mongod
</pre>

Then you should be able to run the app and see hashed and salted passwords
<pre>
cd donation-web-final
npm install
node index.js
</pre>
